        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>
          "drink made from the ground and roasted seeds of a tree originally
          native to Arabia and Abyssinia," c. 1600, from Dutch koffie, from
          Turkish kahveh, from Arabic qahwah "coffee," which Arab etymologists
          connected with a word meaning "wine," but it is perhaps rather from
          the Kaffa region of Ethiopia, a home of the plant (coffee in Kaffa is
          called būno, which itself was borrowed into Arabic as bunn "raw
          coffee"). The early forms of the word in English indicate a derivation
          from Arabic or Turkish: chaoua (1598), cahve, kahui, etc. French café,
          German Kaffe are via Italian caffè. The first coffee-house in Mecca
          dates to the 1510s; the beverage was in Turkey by the 1530s. It
          appeared in Europe c. 1515-1519 and was introduced to England by 1650.
          By 1675 the country had more than 3,000 coffee houses and coffee had
          replaced beer as a breakfast drink, but its use there declined 18c.
          with the introduction of cheaper tea. In the American colonies,
          however, the tax on tea kept coffee popular. Meaning "a light meal at
          which coffee is served" is from 1774. As a shade or color resembling
          coffee, 1815. Coffee-bean is from 1680s. Coffee-mill is from 1690s;
          coffee-spoon is from 1703; coffee-pot is from 1705; coffee-cup is from
          1762. Coffee-shop is from 1838. Coffee-cake is from 1850 as "cake in
          which coffee is an ingredient." Coffee break attested from 1952, at
          first often in glossy magazine advertisements by the Pan-American
          Coffee Bureau.

        <h2>Cultivation</h2>
        <p>
          The traditional method of planting coffee is to place 20 seeds in each
          hole at the beginning of the rainy season. This method loses about 50%
          of the seeds' potential, as about half fail to sprout. A more
          effective process of growing coffee, used in Brazil, is to raise
          seedlings in nurseries that are then planted outside at six to twelve
          months. Coffee is often intercropped with food crops, such as corn,
          beans, or rice during the first few years of cultivation as farmers
          become familiar with its requirements.[46] Coffee plants grow within a
          defined area between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, termed the
          bean belt or coffee belt.[53] Of the two main species grown, arabica
          coffee (from C. arabica) is generally more highly regarded than
          robusta coffee (from C. canephora). Robusta coffee tends to be bitter
          and have less flavor but better body than arabica. For these reasons,
          about three-quarters of coffee cultivated worldwide is C. arabica.[43]
          Robusta strains also contain about 40–50% more caffeine than
          arabica.[54] Consequently, this species is used as an inexpensive
          substitute for arabica in many commercial coffee blends. Good quality
          robusta beans are used in traditional Italian espresso blends to
          provide a full-bodied taste and a better foam head (known as crema).

        <h2>Roasting</h2>
        <p>
          The next step in the process is the roasting of the green coffee.
          Coffee is usually sold in a roasted state, and with rare exceptions,
          such as infusions from green coffee beans,[95] coffee is roasted
          before it is consumed. It can be sold roasted by the supplier, or it
          can be home roasted.[96] The roasting process influences the taste of
          the beverage by changing the coffee bean both physically and
          chemically. The bean decreases in weight as moisture is lost and
          increases in volume, causing it to become less dense. The density of
          the bean also influences the strength of the coffee and requirements
          for packaging. The actual roasting begins when the temperature inside
          the bean reaches approximately 200 °C (392 °F), though different
          varieties of seeds differ in moisture and density and therefore roast
          at different rates.[97] During roasting, caramelization occurs as
          intense heat breaks down starches, changing them to simple sugars that
          begin to brown, which alters the color of the bean.[98] Sucrose is
          rapidly lost during the roasting process, and may disappear entirely
          in darker roasts. During roasting, aromatic oils and acids weaken,
          changing the flavor; at 205 °C (401 °F), other oils start to
          develop.[97] One of these oils, caffeol, is created at about 200 °C
          (392 °F), which is largely responsible for coffee's aroma and
          flavor.[24] Roasting is the last step of processing the beans in their
          intact state. During this last treatment, while still in the bean
          state, more caffeine breaks down above 235 °C (455 °F). Dark roasting
          is the utmost step in bean processing removing the most caffeine.
          Although, dark roasting is not to be confused with the decaffeination
          process. Grading roasted beans
